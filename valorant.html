                I recently talked with <a href="/" onclick="return false;" rel="noopener" class="link keck">James Nguyen</a>, Director of Engineering at Riot, who encouraged me to try and develop a design for a potential mobile adaptation of Valorant in my own time. Even though I’m familiar with design processes in general, I’m fairly new to the field of UI/UX (I’m very used to just doing what I feel like fits best without ever explaining why).</p><br>
                <p>
                This project takes me out of my comfort zone, and focuses on how Riot Games could adapt one of its most successful franchises to the overall experience of the mobile format. In the latter half of the fall 2020 COVID semester, I began to create and iterate on prototypes using existing design systems from Valorant’s PC version and Riot’s Teamfight Tactics mobile app with two main questions in mind:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>What core elements of the game experience need to be included?</p></li>
                <li><p>What have other adapted mobile games in the market done to accommodate players?</p></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <div class="c6 divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h5 class="subtitle"><a href="https://youtu.be/_tKd9Vcky14" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link valorant-link textLink">두둥등장</a> (DUDUDUNGA!)</h5>
            <p>
            I started by looking at one of Riot’s existing IPs — <a href='https://teamfighttactics.leagueoflegends.com/' target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link valorant-link textLink">Teamfight Tactics</a>. TFT is distinct in that it’s a round-based, auto-battler strategy game, and the first of Riot’s franchises to be adapted to the mobile format (coming before <a href='https://wildrift.leagueoflegends.com/' target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link valorant-link textLink">Wild Rift</a>, which recently launched in October 2020). While the mechanics are notably different from Valorant’s nature as an FPS, it’s interesting to take note of the splash screen and experience when the app is first launched.
            </p><br><br>
            <img src="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/11924127aac960220a2cd06ede25eb49c53ff2a9dd54d77dffb37065bb3f5325/TFT-mobile.jpg" class='img'>
            <br><br>
            <p>
            The launch screen has the gold TEAMFIGHT TACTICS stylized logo on a black background. While this is already pretty optimized for landscape mode, the login screen (after choosing “Riot Account” as the sign-in method) redirects to a screen that's stretched and doesn’t fit very well in landscape, and seems to be the default redirect when trying to log in from a mobile browser.
            </p>
        </div>
    <div class="c6 divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h5 class="subtitle">The PC experience</h5>
            <p>
            This is pretty different from what we’re offered on the desktop client when logging in in general; although the League client is separate from the Valorant client, they both present a more cohesive, user-friendly experience which is greatly suited to the platform it’s on. Even though only a third of the client is taken up by the login menu itself, it presents multiple alternative login methods (Facebook, Google, Apple), an option to stay signed in, and the usual “Can’t Sign in?” and “Create Account” links.
            </p><br><br>
            <img src="https://freight.cargo.site/t/original/i/0c07998900488b03a2a8bb6beabdfc3a58e5b603050a4fb21b6a384d5e10d86e/Valorant-desktop.gif" class='img'>

            <br><br>
            <p>
            It’s definitely possible (and easy on the surface level) to adapt this type of login experience to mobile — half of the work is already done. You can hold up your own mobile device to the PC client, and the login menu pretty much already fits your screen. With this in mind, I started drawing sketches of what an adapted mobile version would look like.
            </p>
            <br>
            <img alt="low fidelity explorations" src="assets/sketch1.jpg" class="img">
            <p>
            For the sake of reducing visual clutter (and in keeping with the App Store’s increasingly strict guidelines regarding third-party login involvement), I only kept the same login options which TFT mobile already had: Riot Account and Apple Game Center. I also removed other components of the desktop client, such as the ? icon and the “Stay Signed In” option, since they wouldn’t offer much utility: the former only serves as a reminder of the <a href='https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037264394' class="link valorant-link textLink">Riot username change update</a>, and the latter is fairly redundant as mobile and tablet users tend to stay signed in more than PC users.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <img alt="login screens" src="assets/sketch2.jpg" class="img">
            <br><br>
            <p>
            The greatest flaw of this one third design taken from the PC client is the lack of art/graphics which give Valorant the character and atmosphere that it has even before the game is launched. There’s some really striking <a href='https://www.artstation.com/artwork/W24nrQ' class="link valorant-link textLink">key art</a> created by Ke Su that’s featured in the other two thirds of the launcher that gives (in my experience) a sense of anticipation and appeal that keeps drawing you back to the game, and omitting it completely for a sole white screen login is a big loss.</p><br>
