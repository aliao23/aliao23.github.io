            <h5 class="subtitle">Intro</h5>
                <p>In January 2021, President Biden signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/" onclick="return false;" rel="noopener" class="link nps-link textLink">Executive Order 13895</a> on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, which states:</p><br>
                <p><i>"Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government.  Because advancing equity requires a systematic approach to embedding fairness in decision-making processes, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must recognize and work to redress inequities in their policies and programs that serve as barriers to equal opportunity."</i></p><br>
                <p>The Lab at OPM and the NPS approached my <a href="http://catalog.hmc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=10&coid=2821 ENGR180 class" onclick="return false;" rel="noopener" class="link nps-link textLink">ENGR180</a> class on Human-Centered Design to help "confront a past, present and future experience of a cornerstone federal program," using design to "envision  future experiences of an anti-racist and inclusive National Parks Service."

        <div class="section">
            <h5 class="subtitle">The problem</h5>
            <p>NPS has historically had large disparities in visitorship between white people and people of colour, and has only <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/national-parks/article/more-diversity-how-to-make-national-parks-anti-racist" onclick="return false;" rel="noopener" class="link nps-link textLink">recently</a> started to address its historical legacy of white supremacy and segregation.</p><br> 
            
            <p>
            <a href="http://www.georgewright.org/351scott.pdf" onclick="return false;" rel="noopener" class="link nps-link textLink">Data</a> collected by the National Park Service Visitor Services Project (VSP) from 76 studies show that people of colour represent a comparatively small fraction of national park visitors. Visitors from Hispanic and Asian American backgrounds each comprised less than 5% of visitors to national park sites surveyed, and less than 2% of visitors were Black.
            </p><br>
            <p>
            We followed a design thinking process, where we began by looking to empathise with users.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="c6 divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Empathy</h5>
            <p>We met with 10 different users, ranging from college students and family members to gamers and professors.</p><br>
            <p>We asked questions to try and uncover their personal experiences with national parks, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Where do you spend your free time usually?</p></li>
                <li><p>How often do you go to parks? How often do you go to museums (and analogous spaces)? Why?</p></li>
                <li><p>If not, why not? (Probing for limiting factors)</p></li>
                <li><p>What was your initial motivation in visiting national parks? Has that motivation changed over time?</p></li>
                <li><p>Has COVID-19 impacted how you think of/interact with public spaces? How?</p></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <a href='#nps2'><img src="assets/nps2.jpeg" class='img'></a>
            <a href='#katsu' class='lightbox' id='nps2'><span style="background-image:url('assets/nps2.jpeg')"></span></a>
            <p> Of our 10 interviews, two stood out the most:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Allison</strong>, a middle school teacher at a low-income school who had pioneered an overnight trip to Donner Pass for 80 students (none of whom had been on an overnight field trip before).<br><i>"It was clear the program had never had low income students before. Every staff member was white, and most kids had never gone hiking, so the activities didn't really work."</i></p></li><br>
                <li><p><strong>Antonia</strong>, an immigrant mother who wanted her children to experience nature, but struggled to book visits to National Parks because of difficulties with planning, timing, and feeling unwelcome.<br><i>"I found the planning process nearly impossible ... There are walls put up that are quite strongly felt."</i></p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We created 2x2s and empathy maps to further explore their experiences. We found that Allison values creating a familiar natural space that her students can feel comfortable in as the traditionally white structures of the NPs make them feel uninvested and uninterested in the environment, while Antonia hopes to let her children experience nature and the environment in a safe, familiar context without struggling with planning.</p><br>
            <p>We also generated AEIOU observations for four different locations: national park websites, NP live streams and photos, a community garden, and Richmond Park in the UK.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="c6 divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Creating personas</h5>
            <p>Using our insights from our interviews with Allison and Antonia, we developed five personas with different needs. Of these, we chose to explore:
            <ul>
                <li><p>A low-income 8th-grade student of colour experiencing a national park for the first time on an overnight school trip needs a familiar natural space that they can come back to and feel comfortable in</p></li>
                <li><p>A busy mother who is not fluent in English wants to immerse her kids in the environment, but has difficulty planning a successful trip and needs a way to let her kids experience nature that does not burden her more.</p></li>
            </ul><br><br>
            <div class='imgcontainer'>
                <a href='#nps5'><img src="assets/nps5.png" class='caseimg'></a>
                <a href='#katsu' class='lightbox' id='nps5'><span style="background-image:url('assets/nps5.png')"></span></a>
                <a href='#nps6'><img src="assets/nps6.png" class='caseimg'></a>
                <a href='#katsu' class='lightbox' id='nps6'><span style="background-image:url('assets/nps6.png')"></span></a>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <p>
             These inspired 13 “how might we” (HMW) questions that attempted to dive into specific aspects of their needs, including “HMW find common ground between students of colour and white National Park employees?”, “HMW instill a lasting sense of excitement for students of colour experiencing the outdoors for the first time?”, “HMW reduce the pain points the mother experiences before stepping foot in a National Park?”, and “HMW bring the park experience to her kids in a more accessible way?”.</p><br>
            <p>We then started ideating using a litany of methods, including mood boards, pictures, “worst ideas,” and company goals, eventually coming up with 150+. Photos helped generate ideas such as gamifying the parks and having outdoor career-themed events. We also imagined how a company such as Disney could turn the NP experience into something with wide appeal.

                <li><p>The <strong>Plant an early seed initiative</strong>, where parents would receive a “mystery” package for their children (ages 6+) from the NPS with seeds from species found in different NPs across America. It would come with a multilingual informational booklet containing detailed instructions for planting and caring for the seeds, educational activities to complete in the meantime, as well as a brief history of the land they came from.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Park Noise</strong>, an interactive walkie-talkie given to first-time park visitors after their first visit, allowing them to hear conversations with the park rangers at home even when they are no longer at the park. During downtime, the walkie-talkie would connect to a NP radio station where people could continue to listen and learn.</p></li>
                <li><p>A <strong>monthly bingo-style checklist</strong> for NP-inspired activities that users could complete in their local community, bringing NP values to them by encouraging them to get outside/explore their local environment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Recorded videos from parents</strong> explaining park features and history, where parents explain and introduce parks to their children remotely, giving them a familiar face in a potentially intimidating environment and something to talk about together.</p></li>

            <p>
            After hearing from three users and getting feedback from the NPS, we realized that it would be difficult to coordinate "Planting an early seed" with families which didn't have access to tools, so we developed more ideas to partner with local communities and schools to make it more accessible, as well as including additional information and context regarding the historic background of the parks within the guides.</p><br>
            <p>
            We also received a lot of positive feedback regarding our photo scavenger hunt app/activity idea, with users highlighting how it provided a way to incorporate their existing familiarity with their phone with an unfamiliar environment. We tested “Park Noise” using a walkie-talkie made from LEGOs, and received feedback that it would serve as a good reminder to revisit parks. We iterated by creating new features, such as educational podcasts and an “online/offline” mode, as well as more mock-NP experiences available on the walkie-talkies.

            <p>Despite being in multiple time zones, we enjoyed working on the project as a team and seeing it come to life. We would’ve liked to target the “anti-racist” part of the prompt in a more head-on way, and interviewed current park rangers and employees for their perspectives. If we had more time, we would conduct more interviews based on specific POVs and further develop our “empathise” stage.</p>
