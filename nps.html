            <h5 class="subtitle">Intro</h5>
                <p>In January 2021, President Biden signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link nps-link textLink">Executive Order 13895</a> on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, which states:</p><br>
                <p><i>"Affirmatively advancing equity, civil rights, racial justice, and equal opportunity is the responsibility of the whole of our Government.  Because advancing equity requires a systematic approach to embedding fairness in decision-making processes, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must recognize and work to redress inequities in their policies and programs that serve as barriers to equal opportunity."</i></p><br>
                <p>The Lab at OPM and the NPS approached my <a href="http://catalog.hmc.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=10&coid=2821 ENGR180 class" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link nps-link textLink">ENGR180</a> Human-Centered Design class to use design to "envision  future experiences of an anti-racist and inclusive National Parks Service."</p><br>
                <p>Our deliverables would be a 2-minute video showcasing our process and proposed prototypes to the NPS, as well as a final <a href="https://app.mural.co/t/hcdspring2020class6963/m/hcdspring2020class6963/1614200746688/e4d80cf715d1ce186ab838886978f4de7533c6d1?sender=u20e615201b2867eebd4a4857" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link nps-link textLink">Mural board</a> documenting our design artifacts.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h5 class="subtitle">The problem</h5>
            <p>NPS has historically had large disparities in visitorship between white people and people of colour, and has only <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/national-parks/article/more-diversity-how-to-make-national-parks-anti-racist" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link nps-link textLink">recently</a> started to address its historical legacy of white supremacy and segregation.</p><br> 
            <p>
            <a href="http://www.georgewright.org/351scott.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="link nps-link textLink">Data</a> collected by the National Park Service Visitor Services Project (VSP) from 76 studies show that people of colour represent a comparatively small fraction of national park visitors. Visitors from Hispanic and Asian American backgrounds each comprised less than 5% of visitors to national park sites surveyed, and less than 2% of visitors were Black.
            </p><br>
            <p>We wanted to develop a solution that would provide a more accessible National Parks experience to those in the < 5%, without making them feel uncomfortable or out of place.</p>

        </div>

    <div class="c6 divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Empathy</h5>
            <p>We met with 10 different users, ranging from college students and family members to gamers and professors. We asked questions to try and uncover their personal experiences with national parks, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Where do you spend your free time usually?</p></li>
                <li><p>How often do you go to parks? How often do you go to museums (and analogous spaces)? Why?</p></li>
                <li><p>If not, why not? (Probing for limiting factors)</p></li>
                <li><p>What was your initial motivation in visiting national parks? Has that motivation changed over time?</p></li>
                <li><p>Has COVID-19 impacted how you think of/interact with public spaces? How?</p></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <a href='#nps2'><img src="assets/nps2.jpeg" class='img'></a>
            <a href='#katsu' class='lightbox' id='nps2'><span style="background-image:url('assets/nps2.jpeg')"></span></a>
            <div class='caption nps-link'>Notes from a preliminary interview</div><br>
            <p> Of our 10 interviews, two stood out the most:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><strong class='nps-link'>Allison</strong>, a middle school teacher at a low-income school who had pioneered an overnight trip to Donner Pass for 80 students (none of whom had been on an overnight field trip before).<br><i>"It was clear the program had never had low income students before. Every staff member was white, and most kids had never gone hiking, so the activities didn't really work."</i></p></li><br>
                <li><p><strong class='nps-link'>Antonia</strong>, an immigrant mother who wanted her children to experience nature, but struggled to book visits to National Parks because of difficulties with planning, timing, and feeling unwelcome.<br><i>"I found the planning process nearly impossible ... There are walls put up that are quite strongly felt."</i></p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We created 2x2s and empathy maps to further explore their experiences.</p><br>
            <div class='imgcontainer'>
                <a href='#nps17'><img src="assets/nps17.png" class='img'></a>
                <a href='#katsu' class='lightbox' id='nps17'><span style="background-image:url('assets/nps17.png')"></span></a>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Allison values creating a familiar natural space that her students can feel comfortable in, since the traditionally white structures of the NPs make them feel uninvested and uninterested in the environment</p></li>
                <li><p>Antonia hopes to let her children experience nature and the environment in a safe, familiar context without struggling with planning.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We also generated AEIOU observations for four different "locations": national park websites, NP live streams and photos, a community garden, and Richmond Park in the UK.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="c6 divider"></div>

        <div class="section">
            <h5 class="subtitle">Creating personas</h5>
            <p>Using our insights from our interviews with Allison and Antonia, we developed five personas with different needs. Of these, we chose to explore:</p><br>
                <a href='#nps5'><img src="assets/nps5.png" class='img'></a>
                <a href='#katsu' class='lightbox' id='nps5'><span style="background-image:url('assets/nps5.png')"></span></a>
                <a href='#nps6'><img src="assets/nps6.png" class='img'></a>
                <a href='#katsu' class='lightbox' id='nps6'><span style="background-image:url('assets/nps6.png')"></span></a>
            <br><br>
            <p>
             These inspired 13 “how might we” (HMW) questions that attempted to dive into specific aspects of their needs, including:</p>
             <ul>
                <li><p>HMW <strong>find common ground</strong> between students of colour and white National Park employees?</p></li><br>
                <li><p>HMW instill <strong>a lasting sense of excitement</strong> for students of colour experiencing the outdoors for the first time?</p></li><br>
                <li><p>HMW reduce the pain points the mother experiences <strong>before stepping foot</strong> in a National Park?</p></li><br>
                <li><p>HMW bring the park experience to her kids without significantly adding to her schedule?</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>We then started ideating using methods such as mood boards, pictures, “worst ideas,” and company goals, until we eventually came up with 150+.

            <h5 class="subtitle">Our solutions: protoyping, testing, and iterating</h5>
            <p>We chose five different ideas to prototype, using <a href='#nps15' class="link nps-link textLink">LEGOs</a><a href='#katsu' class='lightbox' id='nps15'><span style="background-image:url('assets/nps15.jpg')"></span></a>, post-it notes, and pez dispensers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>The <strong>Plant an early seed initiative</strong>, where parents would receive a “mystery” package for their children (ages 6+) from the NPS with seeds from species found in different NPs across America. It would come with a multilingual informational booklet containing detailed instructions for planting and caring for the seeds, educational activities to complete in the meantime, as well as a brief history of the land they came from.</p></li>
                <br>
                <div class="imgcontainer"><div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/528992518?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></div>
                <br>
                <li><p>A <strong>scavenger hunt app/photo activity</strong> in the style of <i>Pokémon Go</i>, using gamification to encourage and engage children who might be uncomfortable in and/or less used to a rural environment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Park Noise</strong>, an interactive walkie-talkie given to first-time park visitors after their first visit, allowing them to hear conversations with the park rangers at home even when they are no longer at the park. During downtime, the walkie-talkie would connect to a NP radio station where people could continue to listen and learn.</p></li>
                <li><p>A <strong>monthly bingo-style checklist</strong> for NP-inspired activities that users could complete in their local community, bringing NP values to them by encouraging them to get outside/explore their local environment.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Recorded videos from parents</strong> explaining park features and history, where parents explain and introduce parks to their children remotely, giving them a familiar face in a potentially intimidating environment and something to talk about together.</p></li>
            </ul><br>

            </div><br>
            <p>
            After hearing from three users and getting feedback from the NPS, we realized that it would be difficult to coordinate "Planting an early seed" with families which didn't have access to tools.</p><br><p>We developed more ideas to partner with local communities and schools to make it more accessible, as well as including additional information and context regarding the historic background of the parks within the guides.</p><br>

            <h5 class="subtitle">Reflecting</h5>
            <p>Despite being in multiple time zones, we enjoyed working on the project as a team and seeing it come to life. Since we were severely constrained by time (we only had three weeks), we would’ve liked to target the anti-racist part of the prompt in a more head-on way, and interviewed some current park rangers and employees for their perspectives. If we had more time, we would conduct more interviews based on specific POVs and further develop our “empathise” stage.</p><br>
